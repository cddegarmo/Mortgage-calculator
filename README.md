# mortgage calculator
##### About

This simple program, run from the command line, will output a monthly mortgage payment based on sale price, down payment, property taxes, etc.
The idea originates from a YouTube tutorial for the Java language, but I have refactored my original solution to include better encapsulation,
object creation management, and minimizing the amount of code in main(). It can be compiled and run from _src/main/java/User_.
